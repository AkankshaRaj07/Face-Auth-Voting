Getting Started with Votify
This project was bootstrapped with React.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the voter identity verification process by allowing users to upload their voter ID and capture a selfie for real-time identity matching. The app uses Firebase for storage and user authentication, while the backend compares the uploaded images to ensure accurate identity verification, helping to reduce the risk of identity fraud in elections.

Technologies Used
React – Frontend framework for building user interfaces.

Firebase – For real-time database storage and user authentication.

TensorFlow.js – For face verification and matching algorithms.

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) – For comparing the uploaded image with the selfie.

Flask – Backend framework for handling API requests and image processing.

Features
Voter ID Upload – Users can upload their voter ID for verification.

Selfie Capture – Users can take a selfie for identity verification.

Image Comparison – Uses TensorFlow.js and SSIM to compare the uploaded image and selfie for matching.

Firebase Integration – All images are securely stored and retrieved from Firebase.

OTP Authentication – Secure login through one-time password (OTP) for user verification.
